Welcome to the Digital Academy "Kubernetes CNCF" series. This is Module 2 - Heptio Velero.

Velero gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. Velero lets you:

- Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
- Copy cluster resources across cloud providers.
- Replicate your production environment for development and testing environments.

Velero consists of:

- A server that runs on your cluster
- A command-line client that runs locally

For more information, [the documentation](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.11.0/) provides a getting started guide, plus information about building from source, architecture, extending Velero, and more.

For more information, see the Velero [documentation][docs].
