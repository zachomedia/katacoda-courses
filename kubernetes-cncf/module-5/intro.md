Welcome to the Digital Academy "Kubernetes CNCF" series. This is Module 5 - Deploy Istio on Kubernetes.

In this scenario, you will learn how to deploy Istio Service Mesh to Kubernetes. Istio is an open platform that provides a uniform way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio supports managing traffic flows between microservices, enforcing access policies, and aggregating telemetry data, all without requiring changes to the microservice code

> Note: The scenario uses the sample BookInfo application. The application has no dependencies on Istio and demonstrates how any application could build upon Istio without modifications.
